This project focuses on leveraging various Deep Learning models to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of brain tumor detection and classification. It involves constructing and optimizing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, comparing their performance with pre-trained models, and visualizing learning patterns. The dataset, comprising 3,264 brain MRI images, undergoes rigorous preprocessing, and eight different CNN models are created. Hyperparameter tuning and transfer learning with established models like ResNet50 and VGG19 contribute to optimal performance. Evaluation metrics include accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports. The project not only contributes to medical image analysis but also establishes a foundation for future advancements in brain tumor detection through deep learning. # Brain-tumor-project
